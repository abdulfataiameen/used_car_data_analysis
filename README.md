# Used Car Data Analysis

# Situation:

As part of a project, I analyzed a used car dataset that contained information about a variety of used cars, including their make, model, year, price, location, transmission type, fuel type, odometer reading, and other details. The dataset was extensive and required careful analysis to extract and summarize information about the data, as well as to manipulate the data in various ways.

## Task:

My task was to analyze the used car dataset and extract meaningful insights about the data, which would help in better understanding the market for used cars. I also created a dashboard using Tableau Public to visualize the findings.

## Action:

- I began by loading the dataset into MySQL  and cleaning the data by dropping any irrelevant or missing columns. Next, I performed exploratory data analysis on the data to gain a better understanding of the features, their distribution, and their relationship with the target variable, price.

- I used various statistical and visualization techniques to analyze the data, including histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps. I identified that the make and model of the car, year of manufacture, fuel type, and odometer reading were significant predictors of the car's price.

- To further analyze the data, I grouped the cars by make, model, and year, and calculated the average price for each group. I also created a correlation matrix to visualize the relationships between the features.

- Finally, I created a dashboard using Tableau Public to visualize the findings. The dashboard allowed users to explore the dataset by make, model, and year, and view the distribution of price, odometer reading, and fuel type for each group.

## Result:

- Through my analysis, I was able to extract and summarize important insights about the used car dataset. The analysis showed that the make and model of the car, year of manufacture, fuel type, and odometer reading were significant predictors of the car's price.

- The dashboard I created using Tableau Public allowed users to explore the data visually and gain a better understanding of the market for used cars. The dashboard was also shared with stakeholders and received positive feedback.
